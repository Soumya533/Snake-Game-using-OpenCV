# Snake Game

## Overview
This is a classic Snake Game built using Python with advanced hand gesture tracking features. The objective of the game is to control the snake using hand gestures, eat food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or itself.

## Features
- Hand gesture-based snake control using Mediapipe and OpenCV
- Classic snake movement mechanics
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows
- Score tracking system
- Smooth gameplay experience

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pygame mediapipe cvzone numpy opencv-python
```

## How to Play
1. Run the game script:
   ```bash
   python Snakegame.py
   ```
2. Control the snake using hand gestures detected by your webcam:
   - Move your hand up to move the snake up
   - Move your hand down to move the snake down
   - Move your hand left to move the snake left
   - Move your hand right to move the snake right
3. Eat the food (appears as a square) to grow longer.
4. Avoid hitting the walls and yourself, or the game will end.



## Future Enhancements
- Improve gesture recognition accuracy
- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement different game modes and difficulty levels
- Add a leaderboard to track high scores
- Introduce power-ups and obstacles
